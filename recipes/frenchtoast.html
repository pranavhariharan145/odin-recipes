        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large croissants, halved horizontally, left out overnight</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a shallow bowl. Dip each croissant half into the egg mixture, one at a time, flipping it and lightly pressing down, until well coated.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add four croissant halves, cut side down. Fry until browned on both sides, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven to keep warm while you cook the remaining croissants.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
        <p><b>It's important that the croissants are dry before dipping.</b> As an alternative to leaving the croissants sit out overnight, you can place the sliced croissants on a baking sheet, and toast in the oven at 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) until dry, 12 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p><b>Feel free to substitute almond milk or low-fat milk for the half and half.</b></p>
